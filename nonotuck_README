# Setup
Copy nonotuck_config-tristan.py to nonotuck_config-ENVIRONMENT.py replacing ENVIRONMENT with the current environment. Change the values to match your current environment. Create a symlink from this new file to nonotuck_config.py.

```
ln -s nonotuck_config-ENVIRONMENT.py nonotuck_config.py
```

If desired, commit the new config file to the git repository.

```
git add nonotuck_config-ENVIRONMENT.py
```

Don't worry, the symlink will NOT be committed, because it's in the .gitignore file.

The Nonotuck scripts will now read the configuration on execution.
